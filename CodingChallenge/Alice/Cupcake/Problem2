CupCake Feast - Problem 2

Parth loves going to his favorite bakery, Zillycakes, with N dollars to buy cupcakes. Each cupcake has a cost of C dollars, and the store has a promotion where
they give you 1 free cupcake for every m cupcake wrappers you trade in.

For example, if M = 2 and Parth has N = 4 dollars that he uses to buy 4 cupcakes at C = 1 dollar apiece, he can trade in the 4 wrappers to buy 2 more cupcakes. 
Now he has 2 more wrappers that she can trade in for 1 more cupcake. Because he only has 1 wrapper left at this point and 1 < m, he was only able to eat a total
of 7 cupcakes.
