Problem: Grouping Characture

Write method that tests if the grouping character [], (), {} and <> in a string are balanced, any group that is open must be closed with a corrosponding characters.

Grouping characters can be escaped by using a backslash character. The Character following a backslash character will be ignored, even if it is a grouping character.

In addition to the standard grouping characters string delimiters " and ' are also supported inside a string, aa grouping characters are automatically escaped and should be ignored. String delimiters must be balanced in the same ways as others grouping characters -- each ' or " must be closed with a corresponding ' or ".

() true
([)] false
( false
(abc) true
"{" true
'abc' true
'<\' false
