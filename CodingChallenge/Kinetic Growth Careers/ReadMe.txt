Here is the technical problem that we would like you to solve in the next 72 hours (by 1pm on Monday).  When you are finished, please email us one zip file containing all of the files you created for this exercise.  The code may be in one or multiple java files. The documentation must be separate from the code and should use one of the following extensions: txt, doc, docx, pdf

public int[][] splitEvenly(int[] integerList) throws InvalidInputException {
    // Java method body
}

The Java method above is supposed to take a single list of integers and divide it into two separate lists where the sum of the integers in both lists are equal or close to equal.  Each sublist must have at least one integer.  Please fill out the method body twice, (A) using an algorithm that is accurate and (B) using an algorithm that is faster.  To clarify, our definition of accurate means "guaranteed to find the best possible answer that meets our requirements".  For the faster solution, we still expect your algorithm to find a correct answer most of the time.  The algorithms should not have the same Big-O notation.  You must use the method signature exactly as we've written it.
